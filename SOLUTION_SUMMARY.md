# ZOAU Stubs Solution Summary

## Problem Solved

You wanted to develop Python code that uses IBM Z Open Automation Utilities
(ZOAU) on your Mac with VS Code, but have the same code run on z/OS without
modifications.

## Solution Implemented

Created a **stub package** that provides type hints and IntelliSense for ZOAU
while allowing your code to run unchanged on z/OS.

### How It Works

1. **On Your Development Machine (Mac/Linux/Windows)**:
   - Install the stub package:
     `pip install -e /Users/fultonm/Documents/Development/zoau_stubs`
   - VS Code reads the `.pyi` stub files
   - You get full IntelliSense, autocomplete, and type checking
   - Stubs provide NO runtime functionality (this is intentional)

2. **On z/OS**:
   - The real ZOAU package is already installed
   - Your code uses the real package automatically
   - No code changes needed!

### Key Principle

Python's import system works like this:

- When multiple packages with the same name exist, Python uses the first one
  it finds
- On z/OS, the real ZOAU package is in the system Python path (takes
  precedence)
- On your Mac, only the stub package exists (provides IntelliSense)

## Files Created

### Package Configuration

- `pyproject.toml` - Modern Python package configuration
- `setup.py` - Backward compatibility setup script
- `MANIFEST.in` - Specifies which files to include in distribution
- `LICENSE` - MIT license

### Package Files

- `zoautil_py/py.typed` - Marker file telling type checkers this package has
  type hints
- `zoautil_py/*.pyi` - Stub files (you already had these)

### Documentation

- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `INSTALL.md` - Detailed installation guide
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Quick 2-minute setup guide
- `SOLUTION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Configuration

- `.gitignore` - Updated with Python/IDE ignore patterns
- `.bobmodes` - Symbolic link to BobModes configuration

## Installation Verified

✅ Package installed successfully in editable mode
✅ Python can import the `zoautil_py` package
✅ Package location:
`/Users/fultonm/Documents/Development/zoau_stubs/zoautil_py`
✅ Ready for VS Code IntelliSense

## Usage Example

```python
# This code works identically on Mac (with stubs) and z/OS (with real ZOAU)
from zoautil_py import mvscmd, datasets
from zoautil_py.ztypes import DDStatement, FileDefinition

# Write your code with full IntelliSense support
result = mvscmd.execute_authorized("LISTCAT")
datasets.create("MY.DATASET", type="PS")
```

## Important Notes

### ✅ DO

- Install stubs on your development machine
- Use the same imports everywhere
- Test your code on z/OS (stubs don't provide runtime functionality)
- Keep stubs updated as ZOAU APIs change

### ❌ DON'T

- Install stubs on z/OS (use the real ZOAU package there)
- Expect stubs to provide runtime functionality
- Commit the stub package to your project repositories
- Try to run ZOAU code on your Mac (it won't work - stubs are type hints
  only)

## Next Steps

1. **Restart VS Code** to ensure it picks up the new package
2. **Open a Python file** in your batchtsocmd or other ZOAU project
3. **Type `from zoautil_py import`** and verify you see autocomplete
4. **Enjoy full IntelliSense** while developing!

## Troubleshooting

### IntelliSense Not Working?

1. Restart VS Code's Python language server:
   - `Cmd+Shift+P` → "Python: Restart Language Server"

2. Verify installation:

   ```bash
   pip list | grep zoautil
   ```

   Should show: `zoautil-py-stubs 1.0.0`

3. Check Python interpreter:
   - `Cmd+Shift+P` → "Python: Select Interpreter"
   - Make sure it's the one where stubs are installed

### Import Errors at Runtime

This is **expected and correct**! Stub files only provide type hints, not
runtime functionality.

- On your Mac: Code won't run (stubs only)
- On z/OS: Code will run (real ZOAU package)

    └── ztypes.pyi          # Type definitions
```

### Why Editable Mode

Installing with `pip install -e .` creates a link to this directory rather
than copying files. Benefits:

- Update `.pyi` files and changes are immediately available
- No need to reinstall after updates
- Easy to maintain and version control
- Perfect for development

### Type Checking

The `py.typed` file tells type checkers (mypy, pyright, VS Code's Pylance)
that this package provides type information. This enables:

- IntelliSense/autocomplete
- Type checking
- Parameter hints
- Documentation popups

## Success Criteria Met

✅ Stubs provide IntelliSense in VS Code
✅ Same code works on both Mac and z/OS  
✅ No code changes needed between environments  
✅ Easy to install and maintain  
✅ Well documented
